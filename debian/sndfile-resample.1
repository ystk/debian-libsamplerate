.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sndfile-resample

.SH DESCRIPTION
sndfile-resample converts an audio file at one sample rate to a new usually
different sample rate. It uses libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
to read the input file and write the output file and uses libsamplerate
(http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/) to do the resampling. It works on any file
format supported by libsndfile with any number of channels (limited only by host
memory).

The optional \-c argument allows the converter type to be chosen from
the following list :

     0 : Best Sinc Interpolator
     1 : Medium Sinc Interpolator (default)
     2 : Fastest Sinc Interpolator
     3 : ZOH Interpolator
     4 : Linear Interpolator
